Displays random verses from the holy quran with ajax refresh button and option to share on facebook.

== Description ==

The Quran Verses is a plugin that displays random verses from the holy Quran with translation for you to read with an option of reload button to open and read next verses.

We have also added the facility to share the contents on facebook with beautiful backgrounds including translation that contributes to the lovely feelings of the reader.

Right now, the initial version is loaded with english translation only but we are striving to make the script available in other languages too. We welcome your feedback in localization and development of software features.

Because most of the hosting servers do not allow download of large size files, we have introduced this plugin with 200 verses only. To download full version, please do not forget to visit author's website.
