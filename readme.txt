Displays random verses from the holy Quran with Ajax refresh button and option to share on Facebook.

== Description ==

The Quran Verses is a sidebar widget that displays random verses from the holy Quran with translation on your wordpress website for your visitors to read with option of refresh button to open and read next verses.

We have also added the facility to share the arabic and translation contents on facebook with beautiful backgrounds that contributes to the lovely feelings of the reader.

Right now, the few initial versions will be loaded with english translation only but we are striving to make the script available in other languages too. We welcome your feedback in localization and development of software features.

Because most of the hosting servers do not allow download of large file sizes, we have put in this plugin with 200 verses only . For full version, you are welcome to visit [Noble Soft](http://noble-soft.com/product/the-quran-verses/ "The Quran Verses - Noble Soft")
